# Contributing guidelines

Thank you for your interest in this project!

If you are interested in contributing, **this page contains the golden rules to follow when contributing**. Do note that
failing to comply with our guidelines may lead to a rejection of the contribution.

## The Golden Rules of Contributing

1. **Lint before you push**. We have simple but strict style rules that are enforced through linting. You must always
   lint your code before committing or pushing.

2. **Make great commits**. Great commits should be atomic, with a commit message explaining what and why.

3. **Do not open a pull request if you aren't assigned to the issue**. If someone is already working on it, consider
   offering to collaborate with that person.

4. **Use assets licensed for public use**. Whenever the assets are images, audio or even code, they must have a license
   compatible with our projects.
